JOKER *
How about another joke, Murray? *
What do you get when you cross a *
mentally-ill loner with a system
that abandons him and treats him
like trash?
Murray pauses for a minute, not really listening to Joker,
suddenly realizing the seriousness of the situation. He
starts to turn to camera--
JOKER
(pulls Randall's gun) *
I'll tell you what you get. You get *
what you fucking deserve,-- *
And as Murray Franklin turns back to him, JOKER SHOOTS THE
SIDE OF MURRAY'S HEAD OFF--
